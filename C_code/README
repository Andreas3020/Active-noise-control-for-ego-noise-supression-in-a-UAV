This folder contains the c_code and audio developed during the working of this thesis.
All the code is runable using the makefiles provided in the folder the code is.

Four versions of the ANC algorithm were developed and available her.
The first two versions are the simulations for the time and time-frequency domain.
They are respectively the files RBF_time.c and RBF_TF.c.
The other two versions are the real-life implemenations for the time and time-frequency domain.
They are respectively the files ANC_time.c and ANC_TF.c. An important note before
using the real-life implementations is that they were never actually tested.
They are based on the simulations, but real life testing was impossible due to
the the closure of the labs during the Corona epidemic of 2020.

Other than those four versions the audio recordings used for this thesis
are available here. Two versions of them are availabel, one with and one without lowpass filter (1kHz).
Those with were used in the c-code while those without are only there for the analysis afterwards.
