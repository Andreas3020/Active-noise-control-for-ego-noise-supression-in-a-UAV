This folder contains all of the Matlab code developed for prototyping the ANC algorithm. The prototype is developed in both the time 
and time-frequency domain. For the ease of testing also a Matlab application is developed which can be found in the folder 'Application'.

-- TIME DOMAIN --
The files that are nessecairy to run the code : 
  * T_ANC_multichannel.m
  * ANC_T_to_TF.m (Function)
  
Only the first file 'T_ANC_multichannel.m' needs to be runned which uses the function 'ANC_T_to_TF.m'. 

-- TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAIN --
