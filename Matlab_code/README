This folder contains all of the Matlab code developed for prototyping the ANC algorithm. The prototype is developed in both the time 
and time-frequency domain. For the ease of testing also a Matlab application is developed which can be found in the folder 'Application'.
The audio used for testing is available in the folder 'Audio'. 

-- TIME DOMAIN --
The files that are nessecairy to run the code : 
  * T_ANC_multichannel.m
  * ANC_T_to_TF.m 
  * calc_STFT.m
  * calc_ISTFT.m 
  
Only the first file 'T_ANC_multichannel.m' needs to be runned which uses the functions 'ANC_T_to_TF.m', 'calc_STFT.m' and 'calc_ISTFT.m'. 

-- TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAIN --
The files that are nessecairy to run the code : 
  * TF_ANC_multichannel.m
  * ANC_T_to_TF.m 
  * calc_STFT.m
  * calc_ISTFT.m 
  
Only the first file 'TF_ANC_multichannel.m' needs to be runned which uses the functions 'ANC_T_to_TF.m', 'calc_STFT.m' and 'calc_ISTFT.m'. 

-- APPLICATION -- 
The files that are nessecairy to run the code : 
  * Application_ANC.m
  * ANC_T_to_TF.m 
  * calc_STFT.m
  * calc_ISTFT.m 
  * ANC_t_multichannel.m 
  * ANC_tf_multichannel.m
  
Only the first file 'Application_ANC.m' needs to be runned which uses the other as functions. When the application is runned, it contains
a control pannel to chose all parameters.
